Ingredients
8+ sprigs Fresh Cilantro from the produce department
1/2 cup Sliced mushrooms (not canned)
4 slices bacon (cooked)
1 big handful pepperoni
1 bag of mozzarella cheese
1 fresh pizza dough lump (some pizza shops will sell this to you for a few bucks)
8 oz of your own secret tomato sauce (make it yourself, but use fresh onions and fresh garlic)

Steps to follow
Step1
Heat the sauce while chopping up these ingredients..

Also, if you have a pizza stone, you should let it get hot in the oven about 425 degrees F.
Step2
This step takes some practice. gently shape the dough into a pizza circle utilising gravity to help it shap.. It takes a little practice and watching the guys at the pizza shop helps, just don't attempt to throw it in the air, cause that is really more for show.. although if I could do it that way, I would.. Once it is rounded and begins to stay that way, you can punch the dough a little while it is lying flat on the counter/cutting board.
Step3
First cover with the sauce, then add the mushrooms and bacon, next cilantro and cheese and finally add the pepperoni..
Step4
425 for about 20- 25 minutes then let it set for about 5 mins and enjoy....
